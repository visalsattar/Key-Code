# Key-Code
A repository about my Key Code Projects


Behavior:

When a key is pressed, the page updates dynamically to show:

	1. The key pressed, its key code, and ASCII code.
	2. How many times the key has been pressed in a row.
	3. If the key is a letter, number, or special symbol.
	4. This app provides a visual and interactive display of key presses, useful for understanding key codes and testing how the keyboard interacts with web applications.
